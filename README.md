# Helloooo

You are welcome to my world.

I am Mohammed Dwina, I am a JavaScript software engineer.

I am crazy about coding, problems solving and team collaboration.

I like to create, build and making new things, briefly I like discovering new useful things.

I am also like a social gathering, meet new friends, watching films, football and go to the gym.
